		<h1 id="bio" >About Akira</h1>
		<p>My father has recently retired from the military, so I've lived in many places while growing up. I was born on July 12, 1996 in Landstuhl, Germany. Since then I have lived in Wiesbaden, Germany; Elpaso, Texas; Forthood, Texas;
		  Fort Campbell, Kentucky; Aberdeen, Maryland; and now Middleriver, Maryland. I've stayed in each location for about 2 years and in between each stay there were visits back to Middleriver to see cousins and other family members.
		  During all that travel I took a liking to computers and gaming since I couldn't make many friends. That interest has stayed with me through high school so I decided to study IT at CCBC to get my Associate of Applied Science degree(2017).
		  I plan to continue my studies at Stevenson and obtain a Bachelors degree in Computer Information Systems. I hope to use this degree to find a comfortable technology oriented job that suits me, I'm not sure what that will be yet,
		  but I know that right now I enjoy front-end web development. Anything out there that deals with IT and the Web I'm sure I can learn and become familiar with it.
		  <br><strong>Degree Sought</strong>: Bachelor of Computer Information Systems (<em>May 2020</em>)</p>
